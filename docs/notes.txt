note: need to make multi-dialect queries prominent section later on. When I have a clear example of a codebase that supports multiple dialects at once using sq, then I can make it a selling point.

note: the query-building overhead can even be eliminated: queries can be compiled once and used over and over with speeds identical to raw sql querying with `database/sql`.

note: A single table struct can be used to generate DDL for all three SQL dialects. Dialect-specific DDL is supported. View an [example for the Sakila database](#), defined as structs, targeting [SQLite](#), [Postgres](#) and [MySQL](#) at once.

an entire h1 section dedicated to `ddl`
- need to include the entire reference list for struct annotations as well as the corresponding DDL() method (need to explain the DDL() method in the first place)

- Fantastic material. [https://github.com/CourseOrchestra/2bass](https://github.com/CourseOrchestra/2bass)

every section must be prefixed with a question

FAQ

cover DDL
- introduction covering how DDL works two ways (is this needed?)
    - show an example call that covers everything (tables, views, functions, extensions, enums, constraints, indexes, triggers)
- how to generate structs?
- how to define tables?
    - SQL types to sq types mapping (NumberField, StringField, etc)
        - Numbers -> NumberField
        - Strings -> StringField
        - time.Time -> TimeField
        - JSON -> JSONField
        - []byte -> BlobField
        - uuid.UUID -> UUIDField
        - arrays, tsvector, everything else -> CustomField
    - struct annotations
    - DDL() method
- how to define views?
- how to define functions?
- how to define extensions? (postgres only)
- how to define enums?
- how to define constraints?
    - struct annotations
    - DDL() method
- how to define indexes?
    - struct annotations
    - DDL() method
- how to define triggers?
    - struct annotations
    - DDL() method
- how to handle migration?
    - AutoMigrate
    - Migrate

[How do I run queries that return data?]
cover FetchOne/FetchSlice
- cover Fetch, but present it as the Last Resort

[How do I run queries that don't return data?]
cover Exec

don't cover ToSQL

[How do I do a complex SQL expression?]
cover Fieldf/Predicatef/Tablef/Queryf
- which covers the printf-style formatting
    - advanced topic: explain how anything that implements AppendSQL or AppendSQLExclude will get expanded. also explain the difference between AppendSQL and AppendSQLExclude
- mention how calling custom functions can be done via Fieldf/Predicatef/Tablef

How do I write multi-dialect queries?
- mention how all dialects query builders are basically the same query builder struct
- mention how the params style changes based on the query builder dialect
- mention how the identifier quoting style changes based on the query builder dialect

Can I build a just query once and reuse it for every request?

cover Logging
- logging must be enabled manually for each query (via the DB interface)

== Query Building ==

SELECT reference

INSERT reference

UPDATE reference

DELETE reference

How do I reuse the same predicate across SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE?
